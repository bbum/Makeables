# Glowforge Material Notes

A collection of observations from using various, mostly non-proofgrade, materials with the Glowforge.  These are more observations based on limited experience than they are provably correct claims of fact.

i.e. your mileage may vary.

**Note:** The Glowforge basic has a lower power output than the pro.   For **non-full** power settings, the basic and the pro are supposed to have identical output.  Thus, numeric power settings from 0-100 should yield the same results.   For cuts on a basic, you might need to drop the speed ~10% or bump the speed by ~1.6x and do two passes.

Material | Engrave (Speed / Power / Passes) | Cut | Score
-------- | ------- | --- | -----
3/16" Birch Plywood | 1000 / 80 | 250 / Full
[1/8" Birch Plywood](#M1) | 800 / 60 (fairly light) | 190-250 / Full | | 
[1/4" Birch Plywood](#M6) | 1000 / 80 | 250 / Full / 3 passes
Red Oak Plank 1/4" | 700 / 40 (fairly light) | 200 / Full / 3 passes
Basswood 1/8" | 1000 / 80+ | 200 / Full | 500 / 15 - 20
Basswood 1/4" | 1000 / 80+ | 250 / Full / 3 passes | 500 / 20 - 30
[Slate](#M2) | 900-1000 / 30-50 / 225+ LPI | - | -
Thin Card Stock | | 150 / 10 |
[Bamboo (Cutting Board)](#M3) | 70-85 / 1000
Glass Tile (With Transfer Paper) | 400 / 100
[Glass Sheets](#M4) (Window pane / Aquarium glass) | 1000 / Full
[Cardboard](#M5) (0.15" thick; amazon boxes) | | 190 / 60

#### Thing Engraving Notes

Thing | Engrave | Notes
----- | ------- | -----
Silver Apple Trackpad | 800 / 95 | Any slower or more power risks cracking/crazing glass surface.
iPad / Macbook / iPhone (anodized aluminum | 1000 / 80 - Full | Does not take contrast well, but shows excellent detail.

#### Thing Cutting & Scoring Notes

Thing | Cut | Score | Notes
----- | --- | ----- | -----
Soda Carton Cardstock (0.02") | 150 / 20 | 500 / 5-10 | Fold away from score line seems to work best. See [Template Maker](http://www.templatemaker.nl).

## Process Notes

**Score:** Generally, the maximum # on score is below the threshold that will penetrate the material in the worst case scenario.   On the Glowforge, very tightly space paths may need to have the power reduced.  *Paths with sharp corners are the most problematic for burn thru as the Glowforge does not (yet seemingly to) attenuate the power as it decelerates and accelerates throught the corner.*

## Material Notes

<a name="M1"></a>**1/8" Birch Plywood**

I bought [bulk 1/8" Baltic Birch Plywood from Amazon](https://amzn.to/2I1s0xE) via the Woodpeckers seller.   It is OK quality;  some sheets are warped and there is the occasional plug.   It cuts fairly consistently, but there will be occasional spots that may not cut through at 250, but they will typically cut through at around 190-200.

I use powerful neodymium magnets to flatten warped sheets.  Make sure your magnets are thin enough that the air assist duct on the back of cutting head clears the magnets!!

<a name="M6"></a>**1/4" Birch Plywood**

As plywood gets thicker, there is more opportunity to hide lower quality wood in the middle layers and that typically results in plugs that won't cut consistently.   Quality varies considerbly between sources.  If you're finding that it isn't cutting through consistently, add passes or slow down the cut a bit (though slower will lead to more edge charring).

<a name="M2"></a>**Slate**

*Vary power* doesn't seem to do much on slate.  Probably need to use patterns or random dots to achieve any kind of shading.  Note that craft stores (like Michael's) will often have slate 4" x 4" slate coasters cheap (4 for $3, commonly).

<a name="M3"></a>**Bamboo (Cutting Board)**

The settings given will produce a relatively light engraving.  However, lowering the speed or increasing the power will remove *a lot* of material, which may not be desirable in a cutting board.

With a scrap board, I've been meaning to try multipass with lower speed and lower power to see if I can make a darker mark without removing as much material.

<a name="M4"></a>**Glass Sheets**

A lot of people recommend coating the glass with something prior to engraving.  Typical recommendations include using dishwashing detergent or something else non-flammable that washes off easily.  Others have had success with transfer paper.

With thicker glass, I've had success with no coating or treatment at all.

Note that vary power does not work well with glass.   You'll want to achieve contrast and shading by using patterns or random dots.   Patterns works well.

<name="M5"></a>**Cardboard**

Cardboard boxes are a fantastic prototyping material.  **However**, you *must* keep a sharp eye on any cutting or engraving that takes off more than the outer layer.  The corrugation creates air pockets that are shielded from the air assist and, thus, can easily become pockets of flame.

It is recommended that you do not try designs with lots of closely spaced cuts.  As well, sharp corners will tend to have burn spots.

## Material Sources

[National Balsa](http://www.nationalbalsa.com)

Excellent source for reasonably priced Basswood in various sizes and thicknesses.

**OSH**

Typically has a decent selection of basswood and some other thin hardwoods.  Sometimes has thin plywood, but not consistently and often very warped.

**ACE Hardware** or **Home Depot**

Generally has little to no laser compatible wood.   May have large pieces of slate, rock, or sheets of glass.

**Michael's**

Limited basswood and baltic birch plywood.   Excellent source for card stock and various bits of slate.

[Amazon](https://amzn.to/2G4ZM8U)

Cheap source for decent [baltic birch plywood](https://amzn.to/2I1s0xE).   Has everything else, too, but the prices and quality may vary significantly.  Bulk materials are often not packaged properly and will arrive damaged (bulk cardboard and card stock has been particularly problematic).

**Garage Sales**

Aquarium glass, in particular, is fantastic for engravings.   They are a bit of a pain to take apart (use gloves!), but you can often find a leaky one for a couple of bucks!
