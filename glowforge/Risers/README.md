Glowforge Bed Risers
====================

The height of the honeycomb off of the floor of the *Glowforge* is 1.362" or 34.6mm.

These are a collection of bed risers that can replace the crumb tray and honeycomb to enable cutting odd shaped items with overhangs (like trackpads or dinner plates) or engraving items that will not fit in the 0.5" target range between honeycomb and laser head.

The **comb height riser** does what it says;  lifts an object to the same height as the comb.

For the others, subtract the # engraved on the side from the total height (in inches) of the item to be engraved.   If the result lands within the range of 0-0.5", then use that riser and enter the resulting height in teh GF UI.

For example, if you want to engrave an item that is 1.1" thick, use the **-0.75** riser, subtract, and enter a target focus height of **0.35** in the GFUI.

The SVG was designed for **3mm** Baltic Birch playwood.  It should work for any similar material (which is really about **3.2mm** or **0.12"** thick).
